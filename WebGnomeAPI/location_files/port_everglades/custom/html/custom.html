	The Florida Power and Light (FPL) power plant at Port Everglades uses water to cool and condense the steam used to produce electricity. The cooling water is then discharged into a 1-mile long discharge canal, just south of Berth 29. This canal drains into the Intracoastal Waterway south of the port.

	The 2003 U.S. Coast Pilot 4 reports that "The outflow from the Florida Power and Light cooling water discharge canal, south of Berth 29, will affect passing ships in varying ways depending upon the output of the plant and the size and draft of the ship." The discharge canal outfall is predicted to have minimal effects on the currents of the Port Everglades area and is limited to daytime hours.
