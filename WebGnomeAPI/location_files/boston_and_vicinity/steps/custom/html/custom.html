    Wastewater effluent began to flow into Massachusetts Bay through the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority's Effluent Outfall Tunnel in September, 2000.

    The sewage outfall is predicted to have very limited effects limited to the highlighted area in the picture. Any outfall driven currents would most likely be weak and noticed only in winter during low wind conditions.</p><p>You can choose whether or not to simulate these effects.
