Location Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Location Files were created to guide users through the model setup for a specific region. 
Each Location File contains pre-packaged information about the tides, currents, and 
shorelines in the region it covers. WebGNOME uses the Location File information and 
user input to set up the model.

Once you select a location, you will be asked a series of questions that will help you set up 
your spill scenario. The questions depends on the specific region being modeled. If you need help 
answering a question, click the question mark icon at the top of the dialog box. 

**Note: Location Files are useful for planning but should not be used to model real oil spills!**
