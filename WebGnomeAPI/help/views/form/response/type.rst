Response Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three response types that can be selected: In-Situ Burning, Chemical Dispersants, and Mechanical Recovery. 
For details on model algorithms for the different response types, see the WebGNOME User Manual 
or the specific helps accessible from the individual response options forms (once you make a selection).

* *Mechanical recovery* is a way to remove oil from the surface of the water typically using boom and an oil skimmer. Skimming removes both oil and water and can only be used in relatively calm or low wave conditions.

* *Chemical dispersants* are a way to treat spills over a large area. Dispersants reduce the surface tension between oil and water. This allows the dispersion of the surface oil into small droplets in the water column. Dispersion occurs naturally,but can be enhanced by adding chemical dispersants.

* *In-situ burning* is a cleanup technique which removes oil by burning it while it is still floating on the water. Oil which is allowed to spread without restriction will usually quickly become too thin to sustain a burn. It therefore becomes necessary to collect the oil by using specially designed fire-proof booms towed through the slick.
