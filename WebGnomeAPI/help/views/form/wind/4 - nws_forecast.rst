NWS Forecast
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This automatically creates a **Variable Wind** time series by populating it with data from the latest NOAA
National Weather Service marine point forecast. The blue lines on the embedded map show the offshore extent
of these forecasts. Clicking outside these lines will result in an error message. 

The **Latitude** and **Longitude** buttons at the bottom of the map can also be used to specify a location.

Occasionally, a no forecast 
found message will occur within forecast boundaries - in this case WebGNOME was unable to retrieve the 
data. Please let us know if this occurs and we can look for a solution.

Once the forecast is retrieved, it populates the **Variable Wind** tab, where the time series can be edited 
as needed.
