Wind
^^^^^

Wind is a required element for both weathering and trajectory models.

Note, when entering values use the convention adopted by meteorologists who define wind direction 
as the direction **from** which the wind is blowing. Also, wind speeds are assumed to be at a 10 meter 
reference height above the water surface. 

There are multiple options for adding wind data:

* It can be entered manually as a constant wind value or as a time-series.
* The latest point forecast can be automatically imported from the National Weather Service (NWS) for a specified location. 
* An existing file can be uploaded (|location_link|).
