Oil Query Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Oil Query Form offers several ways to search for an oil.
You can search by name, location, category, API, or viscosity.

* Use the search field to search for an oil by name or location.
* Use the Category drop-down menu to search by category.
* Use API and viscosity sliders by clicking and dragging the bars to select
  a range of values to narrow down the list of choices by API or Viscosity.

If your oil does not appear in the list, try alternate spellings of the oil
or try broadening your search by setting the API and viscosity at their
maximum ranges and choosing the Category All.

Oils can be sorted by name, location, field name, API, or quality index
by clicking on the column label at the top of the table.

A more detailed view of a single oil in the list can be invoked by hovering
your mouse over the oil you are interested in.  When this is done, a button
will appear labeled 'More Info'.
Click that button to get more detailed information about the oil's
Properties, Distillation, and other details.  Estimated values appear as
highlighted red text. When you are satisfied with your choice, click the
select button.
