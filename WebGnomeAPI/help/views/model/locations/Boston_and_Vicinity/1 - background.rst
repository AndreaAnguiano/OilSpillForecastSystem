About Boston and Vicinity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Boston and Vicinity Location File extends from Boston Harbor east through Massachusetts Bay (70° 32.4' W) and from Emerson Point on Cape Ann in the north (42° 38' N), to south of Scituate Harbor in the south (42° 11.1' N). The two busiest harbors in this area are Boston Harbor as the primary shipping harbor and Gloucester Harbor as an anchorage for fishing vessels.


Background
==============================

Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays form a semi-enclosed basin open on the eastern side to the Gulf of Maine. Massachusetts Bay is relatively shallow (mean depth of 35 m) and is separated from the Gulf of Maine by Stellwagen Bank, a shallow, submarine platform about 30 m deep formed by receding glaciers about 18,000 years ago. Two channels connect Massachusetts Bay with the Gulf of Maine. The "North Channel" has a sill depth of 60 m and lies between Cape Ann and Stellwagen. The "South Channel" is about 50 m deep and lies between Race Point (the northern tip of Cape Cod) and Stellwagen. 

Boston Harbor (mean depth 4.9 m) has two channels connecting it with Massachusetts Bay: President Roads in the north and Nantasket Roads in the south. These channels are about 15 m deep (Signell et al. 2000). The coastline and bathymetry of both Massachusetts Bay and Boston Harbor are relatively complex, with many rocky outcrops and islands. Boston Harbor currents are primarily tidal. The dominant subtidal currents are wind-driven and influenced by the Gulf of Maine circulation and freshwater fluxes. Wind-driven currents are particularly important within Boston Harbor and in shallow coastal areas in Massachusetts Bay. 

There are no major rivers entering Massachusetts Bay. The single largest river entering Boston Harbor directly is the Charles River. The Charles-Mystic-Neponset river system does not input enough fresh water to drive surface currents that are significant when compared to the tides. River-driven currents are typically 1-2% as strong as tidal currents. Current patterns were therefore not included for the Charles-Mystic-Neponset river system.

Both Massachusetts Bay and Boston Harbor have a strong seasonal cycle in water properties. Well-mixed conditions prevail in the winter; during the summer, however, there is strong stratification due to both riverine input (mid through late spring and from the rivers emptying into the Gulf of Maine) and seasonal warming (Geyer et al. 1992).

Wastewater outflow from the two former treatment facilities at Nut Island and Deer Island contributed a significant portion of the annual mean freshwater flux to Boston Harbor. This input resulted in surface currents that were significant near the outflow points (Geyer et al. 1992). Because these facilities are no longer in operation, these currents are not modeled in this Location File.

The new Effluent Outfall Tunnel will discharge effluent at a depth of 30 m, at a distance of 14 km out in Massachusetts Bay. There are several diffusers along the underwater pipe. Density-driven mean currents from the new outflow are predicted to be 2-4 cm/s at the surface in the winter and at the pycnocline (15-20 m depth) in the summer. The surface current is predicted to spiral out clockwise within about 5 km from the outflow site (Signell et al. 2000). These currents generally have very little effect on oil spill trajectories. Within this Location File, currents are simulated for the outflow, and the user is given the option of including this current pattern in case he/she wants to simulate a wintertime spill directly over the outflow in no-wind conditions.
