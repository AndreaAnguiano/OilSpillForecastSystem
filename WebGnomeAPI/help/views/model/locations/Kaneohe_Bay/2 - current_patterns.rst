Current Patterns
===============================================

The Kaneohe Bay Location File contains three current patterns.

No tidal current stations were available to use in scaling the tidal predictions. Instead, the tidal current pattern was scaled to the tidal current time file derived from a tide height station in the northwestern section of the bay (near 21° 30.11'N, 157° 49.17'W). The GNOME team differentiated the tide heights to get the times of the floods and ebbs, and then scaled the magnitudes of the floods and ebbs to measurements presented by Neimeyer (1977). At times, uncertainties in the tidal currents may be as large as 0.1–0.2 knots locally.

The offshore, along-shelf currents are weak next to the coast, and strong seaward off the shelf break. These currents are unpredictable and may even reverse directions at times. This variability is taken into account through a high uncertainty in the strength of the current.

Wind-driven currents play an important role in circulation near the Hawaiian Islands. The wind-driven currents in the Kaneohe Bay Location File are estimated from a geostrophic adjustment to SE winds. These currents are scaled to an offshore current value of 1/3-knot for a 20-knot SE wind at an offshore reference point (21° 32.06'N, 157° 44.26'W).

All current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application.
