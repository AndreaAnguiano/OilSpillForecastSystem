About Mobile Bay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mobile Bay is a broad, shallow bay on the Alabama coast that connects with the Gulf of Mexico. The bay serves as the drainage area for the sixth largest river system in the U.S. The drainage basin of Mobile Bay encompasses more than two-thirds of the state of Alabama and parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and Mississippi (about 43,000 square miles, or 69,202 square kilometers). The average depth of the bay is about 10 feet (3 meters), relatively shallow for a body of water that averages about 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) across and 31 miles (49.9 kilometers) long. In 1995, Mobile Bay entered the National Estuary Program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The bay has become significant on a local, regional, and national level because its abundant natural resources provide many ecological, recreational, and commercial uses.


Background
================================

Mobile Bay is a drowned river estuary that is relatively broad and shallow. The bay has a mean depth of about 10 feet (3 meters). Mobile Bay is the terminus for the Mobile River, the Tombigbee-Black Warrior River, and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River. Man-made channels, drainage areas, and oyster reefs have significantly altered the circulation of the bay. Most (about 85%) of the water exchange between Mobile Bay and the Gulf of Mexico is through Main Pass Sound. The remainder of the water flows through Pass aux Herons into Mississippi Sound.

Ships entering the bay travel along the Main Ship Channel (40 feet, or 12 meters, deep) and the Theodore Ship Channel (27 feet, or 8 meters, deep).
