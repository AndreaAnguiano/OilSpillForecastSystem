Current Patterns
====================================================

Three current patterns are used to simulate the circulation in the inner ROPME Sea Area. These include a reverse estuarine flow, river flow, and a wind-driven circulation derived with NNW winds. Tidal flows are not simulated in the Location File because it is concerned with a large scale (>10 km) region and long (> 1 day) timescale simulations.

All current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application.
