Rivers
================================================

The rivers simulated in this Location File include the four Stefansson Sound rivers (Sagavanirktok ["Sag"], Canning, Shaviovik, and Tamayariak Rivers), Colville, Kuparuk and Mackenzie Rivers. 

* The Sag, begins on the north slope of the Brooks Range and flows about 180 miles (290 km) north-northwest across a broad, open floodplain to the Beaufort Sea near Prudhoe Bay.

* Another major river, the Canning, forms the western boundary of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). This river originates at a glacier in the Franklin Mountains and flows 125 miles (201 km) north to Camden Bay.

* The Shaviovik, whose name derives from an Inuit phrase meaning "place where there is iron," flows northeast 75 miles (121 km) to the Beaufort Sea between Foggy Island and Mikkelsen Bay.

* The smallest of the Stefansson Sound rivers, the Tamayariak flows northeast 40 miles (64 km) from its lakehead at the west end of the Sadlerochit Mountains, draining into the Canning River 2 miles (3 km) southwest of its mouth.

* The Colville flows 350 miles (560 km) east and north to the Beaufort Sea, receiving inflow from the numerous tributaries that descend from the western Brooks Range.

* The Kuparuk River flows 150 miles (240 km) northward from the eastern Brooks Range, terminating in the Beaufort Sea

* The longest of the rivers, the Mackenzie, flows northward 1,080 miles (1,738 km) from its source at the shallow swamps and mudbanks of Great Slave Lake in Canada's Northwest Territories. With its watershed covering almost one-fifth of Canada, the Mackenzie River flow parallels the Mackenzie Mountains, ending in a wide fan-shaped delta of channels and islands where it empties into the Beaufort Sea.

Stefansson Sound Rivers
------------------------------------------------

The Stefansson Sound river flows are simulated with user interaction in this Location File. Unfortunately, very little information is available on riverbed bathymetry and flow rates in this region of the Arctic. The Sag River does have a river gauge, with forecasts made at the river's mouth in the Beaufort Sea; however, these forecasts are not available online. In order to create a useful planning tool in this Location File, we have estimated river circulation patterns and likely river flow rates, based on other rivers in the U.S. We have included simple methods for measuring river currents in the *River Flows* Help Topic. If measurements of surface currents are unavailable, we recommend that the user choose high and low values for the river flow, and run the model with these values to evaluate the difference.

Colville River Flow
------------------------------------------------

The Colville River flows into Harrison Bay and is simulated with user interaction in this Location File. The user can choose one of three flow values as estimates of the flow rate. 

The three flow rates (20,000 cfs, 10,000 cfs, and 3,000 cfs) are estimates of high, medium, and low flow rates for river flow after the extremes of the spring freshet have passed. The 1996 Colville River Delta Channel Assessment by Shannon & Wilson, Inc. was used for flow estimates. 

Kuparuk River Flow
------------------------------------------------

The Kuparuk River flows into Gwydyr Bay and is also simulated with user interaction in this Location File. The user can choose one of three flow values as estimates of the flow rate, or can enter a flow rate based on real-time or historical flow values. 

The three flow values available in the pull-down menu are the mean flow rate (2250 cfs) plus/minus the standard deviation (1550 cfs) calculated from historical flow data from 1971-1999. The historical measurements were taken between July 1 and August 31, with flow rates greater than 10,000 cfs discarded, as we did not simulate these flooding conditions in this Location File.

To obtain real-time or historical flow values for the Kuparuk River, visit `USGS Current Water Data for the Nation`_ . On the interactive map, click Alaska (AK). Next, either click the Kuparuk River on the Alaska map or select "Statewide Streamflow Table." Under the heading, "Arctic Slope", select station number "15896000" for the station Kuparuk River near Deadhorse, Alaska.

Mackenzie River Flow
------------------------------------------------

The Mackenzie River flows into the Beaufort Sea and is simulated via user interaction in this Location File. The user can choose one of three flow values as estimates of the flow rate, or can enter a flow rate based on real-time or historical flow values.

The three flow values available in the pull-down menu are the high, medium and low flow rates (30000, 20000, and 10000 m3 s-1) calculated from historical flow data from 1972-2010.

To obtain real-time or historical flow values for the Mackenzie River, see the Environment Canada – Water Survey of Canada hydrometric data web page for the `Mackenzie River at Arctic Red River`_ . Under the heading, Data Category, select "Real-Time." Under the heading, Parameter Type, select "Discharge." Next to Parameter Type, click "Redraw." A time-series graph of the discharge is provided in cubic meters per second.

**Note:** For the Mackenzie River, high, mean, and low estimates were derived from `historical data recorded from 1972 to 2010`_ (and from investigation of the hydrology of the Mackenzie River by the Water Survey of Canada. Additional analysis of these data was provided by the `Canadian Mackenzie GEWEX`_ (Global Energy & Water Cycle Experiment) Study. In situ measurements of discharge and the resultant current speeds at principal channels of the Mackenzie were provided by Water Survey of Canada (Roger Pilling – Hydrometric Supervisor, personal communication, June 21, 2012).
