Charleston Harbor Location File Limitations
=========================================================

The Location File is designed to show the user how floating pollutants such as oil would move under "normal" flow conditions. It should not be used under extreme high runoff or low runoff conditions for the rivers. It should not be used under storm surge or tsunami conditions. The Location File should not be used to predict transport of pollutants along the outer coast. The model domain was extended past the entrance to the harbor to give the user an idea of how far offshore an ebb cycle can carry pollutants into the Atlantic Ocean. It was not meant to predict movement along the outer coast. 

Note that the user is not allowed to start spills everywhere in the domain. This is done because we don't want the pollutant to move quickly outside of the modeling domain and because the modeled currents have high uncertainty along the fringes of the model domain. Remember, the current pattern is calibrated to tidal analysis done along the main channels of the Cooper, Wando, and Ashley Rivers and along the main shipping channel of the lower estuary.
