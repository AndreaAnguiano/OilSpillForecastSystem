Current Patterns
===================================

The currents in the Charleston Harbor Location File are simulated with eleven current patterns. The current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application. There are three patterns for each of the tidal rivers – the Wando, the Cooper, and the Ashley – which are scaled to the tidal current forecast at the mouth of each river, the lower section of each river, and the upper section of each river. There is also a pattern at the harbor mouth and a simplified offshore current pattern.
