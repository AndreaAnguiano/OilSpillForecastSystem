Relaxation State
======================================

The relaxation state is named for the time periods when winds off Pt. Conception “relax” from their usual equator ward direction. The relaxation state occurs primarily in fall and early winter. In terms of the conceptual models of the momentum balance, the relaxation state occurs when poleward, along-shelf pressure gradients overwhelm upwelling favorable or weak winds. 

Currents: The most characteristic feature of the resulting flow field is a strong westward flow (>50 cm/s) through the SBC and into the SMB. Flow in the SMB is strongest along the mainland coast. Cyclonic recirculation in the western SBC is often present, but with a northern limb strengthened with respect to the southern limb. Poleward flow continues out the western entrance to the SBC into the SMB. Within the SMB, the strongest poleward averages are found offshore of the 100 m isobath, where there is generally an offshore, in addition to poleward, component of flow. Closer to shore in the SMB, the flow velocity averages are weaker poleward flow and, in some nearshore locations, southward flow.

The highest velocity fluctuations occur west of Pt. Conception in the regions where the westward flow from the SBC is turning poleward into the SMB. A secondary maximum in the western SBC occurs where recirculating cyclonic flow rejoins the westward flow along the mainland coast. The lowest velocity fluctuations are again found between Santa Barbara and Ventura and in San Luis Obispo Bay.

Winds: Winds during relaxation tend to be either weak and variable or poleward. That is, weak or northwestward winds are usually seen at NDBC 46054 at the western entrance to SBC.

Sea-Surface Temperatures: Satellite sea-surface temperature images during relaxation will often show warm water (17-20°C) extending from Pt. Conception northwestward into the SMB.
