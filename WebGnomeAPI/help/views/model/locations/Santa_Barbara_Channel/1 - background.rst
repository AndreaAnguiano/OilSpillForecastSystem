About Santa Barbara Channel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Santa Barbara Channel is located along the southern California coast of the U.S.

Background
=======================================

The Santa Barbara Channel region is oceanographically complex because of the variety of atmospheric and oceanic conditions that may be present in the area at one time, some with distinctly different regimes separated by up to 10 kilometers. Cold, upwelled water meets warm, subtropic Southern California Bight water in Santa Barbara Channel (Chelton 1984; Lynn and Simpson 1987). The large-scale surface flow is southward (alongshore) in spring and northward (alongshore) between summer and winter, but these large-scale flows can reverse for periods up to a week (Harms 1996). The mean flow of Santa Barbara Channel is a cyclonic (counterclockwise) eddy located at the western end of the channel.

The circulation in the Santa Barbara Channel is driven by (Harms 1996):

* Wind Stress.
* Wind Stress curl (Ekman pumping).
* Along-shelf pressure gradients.

The Santa Barbara Channel Location File simulates mean conditions in the six circulation modes defined by Harms (1996). Using the Location File, you may not be able to simulate real conditions on a particular day; however, the Location File is sufficient for building intuition and creating scenarios.
