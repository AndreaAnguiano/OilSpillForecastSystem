About Prince William Sound
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prince William Sound is an embayment of the Gulf of Alaska, located in south-central Alaska. Prince William Sound is bordered on the west by the Kenai Peninsula; Montague Island and Hinchinbrook Island lie at the main entrance to the sound. Prince William Sound is well known as the location of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, which spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil into its biologically rich waters.


Background
============================

Prince William Sound is one of the larger estuaries in North America. Its waters have a surface area of approximately 10,000 square kilometers. Rivers and a significant number of tide-water glaciers supply fresh water to the sound. The circulation is thought to be primarily tidally driven.

Prince William Sound has two main connections to the Gulf of Alaska: Hinchinbrook Entrance and Montague Strait, with some smaller channels on the eastern side. Three smaller fjords connect to Prince William Sound and probably affect the circulation: Port Valdez, Port Wells and Orca bay.
