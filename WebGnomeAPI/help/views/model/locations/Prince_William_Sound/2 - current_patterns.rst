Current Patterns
==============================

The Prince William Sound Location File uses five current patterns to simulate the circulation and tides. The tides at Hinchinbrook Strait, Port Wells, and Montague Strait are each simulated with a single current pattern. The tides in Valdez Arm and Port Fidalgo are simulated with the same current pattern. The fifth current pattern simulates a net flow of about .5 knot into Prince William Sound through Hinchinbrook Entrance and out of Prince William Sound through Montague Strait and, to a lesser extent, Latouche, Elrington, and Prince of Wales Passages.

All current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application.
