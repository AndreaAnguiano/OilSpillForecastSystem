About St. Johns River, Florida
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At 310 miles [499 kilometers] long, the St. Johns River is the longest river in Florida, and the longest river in the United States that flows *northward*. The St. Johns is also one of the "laziest" rivers in the world because its total drop, from its source in marshes south of Melbourne to its mouth in the Atlantic near Jacksonville, is less than 30 feet [9.1 meters]! This slow flow makes it difficult for the river current to flush pollutants. 

The Lower St. Johns River (LSJR) extends from where the Ocklawaha River joins the St. Johns River to the sea, and includes slightly more than a third of the total length of the St. Johns River. This Location File does not simulate the entire LSJR, but does extend slightly beyond the dredged channels where vessels transit and beyond historical spill locations.


Background
================================

The St. Johns River circulation is controlled by the moderate tides. Although the St. Johns River is the longest river in Florida, it is only fifth largest in terms of discharge volume. Freshwater runoff does not significantly affect the circulation. The freshwater output makes up about 1/7th of the average tidal flow (Anderson and Goolsby 1973). 

The two jetties at the entrance to the St. Johns River are built of rip-rap, which is permeable to spilled oil. We have simulated these jetties as solid structures in this Location File, for ease of implementation. If you have any trajectories that bring oil near the jetties, you should consider that oil could go through the jetties, in addition to the results of your trajectory.

Within this Location File, the extensive marsh areas are simulated as solid shoreline. Thus, GNOME will show that oil has beached on the shoreline and will not show any penetration into marsh regions. When running your scenarios, you should consider that any oil at the edge of a marsh could potentially move into the marsh.
