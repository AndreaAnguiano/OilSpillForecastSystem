Current Patterns
======================================

The Portsmouth Location File contains four current patterns: tides and outer coast. All current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application. The outside mean current pattern is set to flow from the north to the south. This pattern should not be relied upon to reflect any variability in the currents. Caution should be exercised with the use of these currents. 

This Location File was the first to be created using a long-term current meter record, so currents and uncertainty bounds were scaled differently each month. As a result, when you set up your scenario, you will need to select a month to determine the uncertainty parameters. If your model run begins and ends in the same month, select that month for uncertainty parameters. If your model run spans a month, we suggest that you run GNOME twice, once for the beginning month and once for the ending month.
