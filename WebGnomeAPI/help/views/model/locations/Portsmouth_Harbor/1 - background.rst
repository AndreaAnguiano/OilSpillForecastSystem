About Portsmouth Harbor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Portsmouth Harbor stretches across Newington, Portsmouth, and New Castle in New Hampshire, and the Maine communities of Kittery and Eliot. The last 8.8 miles of the 13-mile long Piscataqua River constitute the harbor. The Piscataqua has one of swiftest and most difficult currents in the country. When the tide comes in, it reverses the river's normal flow. Travel by tankers and other large vessels is restricted to slack tide, when the current is near zero. This ice-free deep-water harbor has been used for shipping since the 1600s.


Background
==========================

Portsmouth Harbor is an enclosed port with a narrow opening to the Atlantic Ocean. The largest river entering the area is the Piscataqua River and is approximately 12 miles long. The port and its approaches are dredged and maintained at a minimum depth.
