Current Patterns
=================================

The Apra Harbor Location File contains two current patterns, one for tidal currents within the harbor, and another to represent mean flow from the North Pacific Equatorial Current. Both current patterns were created using the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulations (CATS) model.

The simplified tidal currents used in the Location File do not represent the eddies that Maas indicates are present in the harbor. Tidal ranges within the harbor are usually less than one meter. Tidal current records were not available, so a ten-year record of simulated current time series was constructed by differentiating the tidal height file. This record was scaled to 1-1/2 knots maximal tidal current at the entrance to the harbor.

The residual currents were modeled using the NOAA hydrodynamics model Wind Analysis of Currents (WAC), which generates current patterns in part by using wind stress as a forcing function. The steady state winds were 15 knots from the east to represent the Trade Winds. The flow convergence at Orote Peninsula was simulated by assuming a set down in water surface elevation at the northern and southern part of the island compared to mean ocean levels offshore.
