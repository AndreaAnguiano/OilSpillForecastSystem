Current Patterns
========================================

The Delaware Bay Location File uses four current patterns to simulate tidal and subtidal circulation. The tidal current pattern is scaled to tides 0.7 nautical miles ESE of Cape Henlopen (38째 47.97'N, 75째 4.9'W, NOS tidal prediction station #4021). Offshore flow is scaled to 3 cm/s offshore at 38째 53.9'N, 74째 44.9'W. The scaling constant was extrapolated from mean flow reported in Beardsley and Boicourt (1987) and from near-real time observations from Rutger's Institute of Marine and Coastal Studies Coastal Ocean Dynamics Application Radar (CODAR) website.

Two wind-driven circulation patterns are used to simulate wind driven flow: one pattern from NW winds and another from SW winds. These two patterns are combined linearly to produce a current pattern appropriate for the user-defined wind field.

All current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application.
