About San Diego Bay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

San Diego Bay is located in the southwestern corner of the U.S. San Diego Bay has an excellent natural harbor, which has made it a busy commercial port. San Diego Bay is also headquarters for the 11th U.S. Naval District, with major naval and marine training bases also located there.


Background
============================================

San Diego Bay is a long, narrow crescent-shaped bay (25 km long, 1-3 km wide). The bay can be divided into two regions: a deeper outer bay and a shallower inner bay. The tidal range is on the order of 1.7 m with a maximum of 3 m. The tidal phase lag from the mouth to the back portion of the bay is only 10 minutes. San Diego Bay is a "low-inflow estuary" (Largier et al. 1996). With a mean rainfall of 26 cm/year, which occurs mostly in winter, San Diego Bay has very low freshwater input. The low inflow of fresh water creates very little buoyancy forcing, so the density-driven circulation is driven by seasonal heating and evaporation. 

The mouth of San Diego Bay has been modified by the construction of the Zuniga jetty, which extends approximately 1 mile offshore of Zuniga Point. The Coastal Pilot states that approximately "two-thirds of the jetty has only small sections that are visible at high water."

Kelp forests extend approximately 2 km southward from Point Loma and along its western side. These thick kelp forests create seasonal damping of currents to about one-third their values outside (Jackson and Winant 1983).

Offshore of San Diego Bay, the long-term averages of the currents are equatorward in all seasons, with velocities as high as 10 cm/s (Winant and Bratkovich 1981). Ninety-eight percent of current measurements are between 1 and 25 cm/s (Winant 1983).
