Current Patterns
==============================================

The Narragansett Bay Location File uses four current patterns to simulate tidal and subtidal circulation. The tidal current pattern is scaled to tides west of Dutch Island in the West Passage (41° 30.3' N, 71° 24.6' W; NOS tidal prediction station #2326).

Two wind-driven circulation patterns are used to simulate wind-driven flow: one pattern from northerly winds and another from easterly winds. These two patterns are combined linearly to produce a current pattern appropriate for the user-defined wind field.

A steady Providence River outflow circulation pattern is used to simulate a net surface outflow from Narragansett Bay.

All current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application.
