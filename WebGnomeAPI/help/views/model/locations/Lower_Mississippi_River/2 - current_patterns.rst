Current Patterns
============================================

As water flows down river, it spreads out through the channels and passes along the river. At the larger Head of Passes, the water divides among the four larger passes. Predicting the relative amounts of water flowing out through each of the passes is difficult because it is a function of the amount of water flowing down the river and any sea level setup at the end of the passes. In this simple Location File, we consider only the river flow effects without the sea level setup. We believe this simplistic approach still provides a useful tool for drills and planning.

The current pattern was created in the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulations (CATS) model using the shallow water wave constraints. Current speed scaling is from a rating curve for the Mississippi River from the NOAA National Weather Service.
