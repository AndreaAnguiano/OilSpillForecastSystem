Weathering
^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows graphs of:

* remaining floating oil as a function of time
* the amount of oil evaporated as a function of time
* the amount of oil dispersed into the water column
* the amount of oil removed from the surface due to sedimentation
* if emulsion is predicted: the water content and corresponding volume
* oil density as a function of time
* oil viscosity as a function of time

In the graphs, the line represents the most likely amount, while the shading represents uncertainty. Hovering your mouse over the graph will show the values of the data for that time period on the graph to appear. For longer duration spills, this graph may take some time to load.
