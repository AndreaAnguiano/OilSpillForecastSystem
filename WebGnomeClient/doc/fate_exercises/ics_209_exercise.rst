ICS 209 Exercise
################



Incident
========

An offshore platform crew,  watching 4 seasons of a popular cable TV show  rather than their gages, cause a three-day leak of 15 bbl/hr of a light Louisiana crude

Wind is 10 knots the first day, strengthens to 20 knots for the next two days and then returns to 10 knots, always from the north.

Water temp is 68 F under open ocean conditions.

Limited skimming equipment is employed and recovers 5/bbl hour for eight hours during the first day.

On the second day, dispersants are proposed on 20% of the surface slick with an estimated efficiency of 40%.

The on-scene command wants an ICS 209 form prepared for day 2 of the spill.

Use WebGNOME's Fate Mode to provide the data for the ICS 209 form.

Response Options:
-----------------

Limited skimming equipment is employed and recovers 5/bbl hour for eight hours during the first day.
