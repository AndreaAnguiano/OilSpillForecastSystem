Script to copy the rst friles from for the location tech docs from the webapi repo

This duplicates the files, but we can maintain them in one place.

Kinda klunky, but should work.

This script is designed to be run from this dir, and with the
webgnomeapi repo sitting next to this one. But that can be changed
right at the top of this script
