Getting Started
###############

There are multiple ways to get started using WebGNOME. For example, various
wizards are available that guide users through setting up a scenario. In this 
case, users will be prompted to answer a sequence of questions. Users can 
also choose a Custom Setup and load and enter all input data manually.

Specialized interfaces (or wizards) are available for setting up runs that
consider oil weathering only (with an interface similar to the well known 
NOAA ADIOS2 model), for setting up runs that include assessment of response 
operations (the Response Options Calculator Wizard), or for using Location Files. 
More information on these different ways to use WebGNOME is found in 
subsequent sections.

The Menu Bar
------------

No matter which way users begin setting up the model the Menu Bar will be 
visible at the top of the page. Use the Menu Bar to create a New model scenario, to Save
an existing model scenario, and to access Help Pages.

Once the model scenario is setup, the output can be Run as a spill animation or exported in 
various formats. This option is also available from the menu bar.

Switching between Model Views
-----------------------------
The WebGNOME application also has various "Views" for setting up and viewing the spill scenario.
To switch between Views in the model, the icons
pictured below are always found on the top right of the Menu Bar.

 - To make modifications to the model setup, switch to Setup View.
 - To view the oil budget, switch to Fate View.
 - To view the oil trajectory, switch to Map View.

Using Setup View
----------------

Setup view is used to interact with the model components, e.g. the map, the "movers" (physical
forces like winds and currents which move the spill), and the "weatherers" (processes that 
change the mass or other physical/chemical properties of the spill). 

Within Setup View a number of panels are used to interact with these various components. 
These panels can be used to change basic model parameters (e.g. the model start time 
or run duration within the "Model Settings" panel) or to load or create movers (e.g. 
the "Wind" and "Current" panels). If a Location File Wizard is used to get started, 
these panels may be auto populated. Users can then use this View to make edits to the 
model parameters. 

**Note that if the model was initially set up using the Fate or Response Options Wizard, clicking 
Setup View will return the user to that more simplified interface.**

Within panels in Setup View are icons to Create components (+ symbol), edit components (pencil), and 
delete components (trashcan). In some panels, multiple components can be added. 
For example, if more than one data source for winds or currents are available. Once created, 
components will show up in a list at the bottom  of the panel. The Edit icon can then be 
used to modify parameters unique to that component (e.g. in the case of a wind or current, parameters 
include being able to turn the mover on/off in the model run or to extrapolate the data).

Timeline Graphic (Under Development)
------------------------------------

The timeline at the bottom of the Setup View page is provided to help make sure movers and 
spills are in sync with the model run time. For example, when loading in data for currents 
or winds, this visual shows the start and end time for the data with respect to the model 
start and end times. It can be very useful for diagnosing model run time errors related to 
time mismatches.
