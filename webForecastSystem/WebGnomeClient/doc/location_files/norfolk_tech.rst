About Norfolk, Virginia
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Norfolk, Virginia Location File covers the James River from the western end of Jamestown Island to Chesapeake Bay. It also includes the Elizabeth River, from Paradise Creek to the James River. The James River originates in the Allegheny Mountains and flows to the southeast, terminating in the Chesapeake Bay. It drains approximately one fourth of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Commercial navigation extends from Chesapeake Bay up river approximately 80 miles [128 km] to Richmond, Virginia. 

Background
==================================

This Location File is designed to simulate the river flow from Jamestown Island to Chesapeake Bay. Hampton Roads is a natural tidal basin formed by the confluence of the James, Nansemond, and Elizabeth Rivers. The area has been a major anchorage point since colonial times. The port is located approximately 18 miles [29 km] from open ocean and is one of the world's deepest, natural ice-free harbors. 

At this point, the James and Elizabeth rivers are tidal, not inputting enough fresh water to significantly drive surface currents when compared to the tides.


Current Patterns
=================================================

The Norfolk Location File contains one current pattern, which was developed using the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application. The tidal current pattern is scaled to the tidal prediction station at Carney Island Reach, station number 5276 (36° 53.43' N, 76° 20.15' W). The tidal pattern is reflective of a net outward transport of water from both the James and Elizabeth Rivers.
