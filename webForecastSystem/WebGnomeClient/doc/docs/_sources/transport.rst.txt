Simulating Transport
####################

WebGNOME is not limited to use for oil spills but can be used as a stand-alone transport model 
for all types of floating objects or substances. In this case, rather than select an oil from the 
ADIOS database, simply 
leave the substance as "non-weathering". If an oil is selected, weathering algorithms will automatically 
be applied and the mass balance and other physical properties output graphs will be shown in Fate View 
(see :doc:`fate`).

Although the web interface does not yet support 3D simulations, that functionality is available 
using the pyGNOME scripting environment. See https://github.com/NOAA-ORR-ERD/PyGnome for more.

Setting up the Model
====================

Setting up a transport simulation in WebGNOME requires the following types of information.

**Map**

A map is necessary to determine when particle interacts with the shoreline (e.g. oil beaching). 
Typically, shoreline data is imported through a file upload. Global shoreline
data can be obtained in a supported format through |location_link|. If you'd like to 
use your own data to create a map, see the |location_link2|.

In idealized cases, you can also opt for an *Infinite Ocean* or *Parameterized Shoreline*.

**Winds**

Wind is also a required element for modeling surface transport.

When entering values use the convention adopted by meteorologists who define wind direction 
as the direction *from* which the wind is blowing. Also, wind speeds are assumed to be at a 10 meter 
reference height above the water surface. 

There are multiple options for adding wind data:

* It can be entered manually as a constant wind value or as a time-series.
* The latest point forecast can be automatically imported from the National Weather Service (NWS) for a specified location. 
* An existing file can be uploaded (|location_link2|).

**Surface Currents**

Surface currents are also important to consider when modeling surface transport. Although WebGNOME can be
run with wind driven transport only, realistic simulations generally need to also include surface currents.
Ocean current data on a regular, curvilinear, or triangular grids (e.g. output from a hydrodynamic model)
can be imported into WebGNOME. At present, only specific file formats are supported (eventually any CF-compliant 
file should be compatible). Details on the supported file formats
can be found in the |location_link2|. 

**Horizontal diffusion**

Random spreading, i.e. diffusion, is included by a simple random walk with a square unit probability. 
The random walk is based on the diffusion coefficient which represents the horizontal 
eddy diffusivity in the water. The model default is 100,000 cm2 s-1.


Using Location Files
====================

Location Files were created to guide users through the model setup for a specific region. They come 
pre-packaged with a map, horizontal diffusion, and surface currents already created. Learn more in 
the :doc:`Location Files <location_files>` section of the User Guide.
