WebGNOME is a publicly available oil spill trajectory and fate model that simulates oil movement
and weathering due to winds and currents. GNOME was developed by the NOAA Office of Response 
and Restoration (OR&R) Emergency Response Division for use in oil spill response.

You can use WebGNOME to:

    - Predict how winds, currents, and other processes might move and spread oil
      spilled on the water.
    - Learn how predicted oil trajectories are affected by inexactness ("uncertainty") in
      current and wind observations and forecasts.
    - See how spilled oil is predicted to change chemically and physically ("weather")
      during the time that it remains on the water surface.


To use WebGNOME, you describe a spill scenario by entering information into the program and 
potentially uploading files with ocean currents, wind forecasts, and shoreline information.
For examining the fate of spilled oil, a specific oil can be selected from a database 
of more than a thousand different crude oils and refined products.

WebGNOME then creates and displays an oil spill animation showing the predicted trajectory
of the oil spilled in your scenario. You can also view graphs containing information on 
the "oil budget" or partitioning of spilled oil between the water surface, water column, and 
atmosphere. 

To make setting up and running WebGNOME easier, users can choose to start with a webGNOME
Location File. These exist for many Unisted States waterways and contain pre-packaged tide 
and current data. 

Alternatively, users can choose to utilize shoreline data and output from numerous publically 
available ocean and meteorological models through the GOODS website.
