<p>Try out these examples to learn the basics of modeling oil spills in
Boston Harbor and vicinity. Explore how changing tides, winds, runoff
from the Merrimack River, and wastewater outflow can affect the
trajectories of oil slicks. In addition, one example demonstrates how
model and observation limitations can be overcome by including Uncertainty
in the model solution. This knowledge will help you in designing your
own WebGNOME model runs.</p>
<div class="section" id="example-1">
<h2>Example 1<a class="headerlink" href="#example-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tides are an important part of the circulation in Boston Harbor.
In this example, you will examine the effects of tides by starting a
spill at two different times in the tidal cycle,
once at the beginning of a flood tide:</p>
<p>Start Time: May 4, 2000 at 6:00 p.m. (1800)</p>
<p>and once at the beginning of an ebb tide:</p>
<p>Start Time: May 5, 2000 at midnight (0000)</p>
<p>The winds at the time of the spill are 5 knots from the SE.
In this example, we won’t simulate the effects from
the Effluent Outfall Tunnel. We will place an approximately
100-barrel spill near the Deer Island entrance to Boston Harbor.</p>
<p>Begin by selecting the Boston and vicinity Location File which will launch
the Wizard to guide you through setting up the scenario. Use the information
in the following table as you advance through the Wizard.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="32%" />
<col width="68%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Start time:</td>

<p>Once you have run the model for both start times, zoom in to the spill area and
examine the differences in beach impacts between the two spills. To more easily
visualize the difference between the spill impacts, you could take
a screenshot of the map at the end of the first run.</p>
<p>How do the two spills differ in the amount and location of pollutant?</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>
<p>1.  If you only want to change one spill parameter (like the start time
of the spill in this example, there is no need to reload the Location File
and step through the Wizard. Instead, use the buttons on the Menu Bar to
switch from Map View to Setup View. In Setup View there are various panels which
allow you to edit the model setup. In the <strong>Spill</strong> panel, click on the edit
(pencil) icon of the spill you created to edit the time of release.</p>
<p>When you change the start time of the spill, you will likely want to
change both the spill start time (done via clicking on the edit icon on the <strong>Spill</strong> panel)
and the model start time (via the edit icon on the <strong>Model Settings</strong> panel.
If you change the spill start time first, WebGNOME will automatically
prompt you to change the model start time to match the spill start time.
So it is a good idea to always change the spill start time first.</p>
<p>2.  In the Map View, you can open the <strong>Layers</strong> panel (top right) to select different basemaps
for familiarizing yourself with the local geography.</p>
<div class="section" id="answer">
<h3>Answer:<a class="headerlink" href="#answer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When the spill starts just before the flood tide, oil
reaches the Charles River and the northern portion of Boston Harbor.
The oil beaches in these areas and is not immediately carried back
out with the ebb tide. When the spill starts at the beginning of the
ebb tide, the oil also impacts the western portion of Broad Sound.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-2">
<h2>Example 2<a class="headerlink" href="#example-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Wind can have a significant effect on a spill because it both
moves the oil along the water’s surface and drives currents. Rerun the
ebb tide spill (May 5 at 0000) with 5-knot wind from the NW, then with
no wind.</p>
<p>How do the oil’s trajectory and shoreline impacts change from the previous example?</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>
<p>To change the wind conditions in WebGNOME, in Setup View,
click on the edit icon in the <strong>Wind</strong> panel then enter the wind speed
and direction in the Constant Wind tab. Because you are entering a
“Constant Wind” the Date &amp; Time Field is not important as the
same values will be applied at all model times.</p>
<p>For the “no wind” case, you
either set the wind speed to 0 or delete the Wind from the list.</p>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>Answer:<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Even a very light wind dramatically changes the oil’s
trajectory! With the SE wind in Example 1, the spill moved to the
northwestern regions of the harbor. Now, with the NW wind, the spill
moves to the southeast, oiling the northern shores of Long Island,
Houghs Neck, Peddocks, Hull, and other harbor islands. Without the
wind, the oil does not spread as far north or as far south as it
does with the wind’s assistance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-3">
<h2>Example 3<a class="headerlink" href="#example-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Forecasts of environmental parameters are inherently uncertain.
For example, wind and weather forecasts can be “off” in the speed,
direction, or timing of winds. WebGNOME supports a “Minimum Regret”
solution in addition to the “Best Estimate” solution that you have been
running. The “Minimum Regret” solution takes into account our
uncertainty in wind, horizontal mixing, and currents.</p>
<p>Rerun the previous scenario, increasing the wind to 10 knots from the
NW. This time, run WebGNOME with the “Minimum Regret” solution turned on.</p>
<p>Examine the difference between the “Best Guess” (black) and “Minimum Regret” (red) trajectories.
Why do you think this type of information would be useful?</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>
<p>To include the Minimum Regret (Uncertainty) solution,
click the box labeled “Include the Minimum Regret (Uncertainty)
solution” in the Model Settings panel in Setup View.</p>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h3>Answer:<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The “Minimum Regret” solution shows where else the spill
could go if the currents, winds, or other model inputs were a little
bit different. In this case, the “Minimum Regret” solution shows
that the spill impacts could be more severe in the northern and
western regions of the harbor, with the possibility of pollutant
reaching areas near Deer Island, Spectacle Island, and Boston Inner
Harbor. To the east, the spill could also be more extensive, with
oil floating north of Little Harbor and Cohasset Harbor.</p>
<p>Responders use both the “Best Estimate” and “Minimum Regret”
trajectories to make decisions about how they will allocate response
resources. Sometimes a highly valued environmental resource (e.g. an
endangered species) may be important enough to protect, even if it
has a low probability of being oiled.</p>

<h2>Further Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#further-examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The next few examples are brand new scenarios. You can choose to
edit the various components as we did in the previous examples, or
you may find it easier to re-load the Location file and step
through the Wizard (just choose “Select a
Location File” from the New pull down menu).</p>
<p>For these
examples, you can turn off the “Minimum Regret” solution and don’t
include effects from the Sewage Outfall (we’ll learn how to turn
this on in Example 6.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-4">
<h2>Example 4<a class="headerlink" href="#example-4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Merrimack River has very high flows in the spring. This
strong pulse of fresh water into the Gulf of Maine leads to a coastal
current in Massachusetts Bay. Run two 1-day spill scenarios of 70,000 gallons
of non-weathering oil near the entrance to Gloucester Harbor at
42° 34.73’ N, 70° 38.97’ W.
Run one scenario during the spring freshet, on May 15, 2000 at 3:45 p.m.
Run another scenario during the fall on
October 15, 2000 at 7:15 p.m. Both of these times represent the
beginning of a flood tide. In each case, there are no winds.</p>
<p>How does the oil’s trajectory change from the spring to the fall example?</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>
<p>Remember to change the spill release time first rather than the model
start time to automatically synchronize these two.</p>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h3>Answer:<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the spring, much of the oil is pushed to the
southwest, away from Gloucester Harbor. In the fall, however, most
of the oil ends up in the harbor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-5">
<h2>Example 5<a class="headerlink" href="#example-5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Different types of pollutants weather differently. In the
previous examples, the pollutant that spilled did not change with time
(it was “non-weathering”). Now you are going to run a 1-day scenario that
compares the effects of different types of pollutants.</p>
<p>A damaged vessel begins to leak fuel as it heads into Boston Harbor
along Nantasket Roads. The vessel spills 30,000 gallons of product
between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. on May 4, 2000 as it travels from 42° 19.16’
N, 70° 53.55’ W to 42° 18.76’ N, 70° 55.25’ W. Winds are 5 knots from the W.</p>
<p>A scenario that includes weathering requires additional water property
information. In the Water panel, enter a water temperature of 55° F and
use the defaults for the other parameters.</p>
<p>Run the above scenario for a barge carrying a heavy fuel oil (e.g., an
IFO or Intermediate Fuel Oil) and for a fishing vessel carrying
a diesel fuel. At the end of your 24-hour
prediction, write down the mass balance for each product in the table
below.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>1. The spills you have set in previous examples have
been point source spills, representing catastrophic releases at a
particular time and location. The spill described in this example is
a spill from a vessel that is leaking as it is moving. To model this
“line source” spill in WebGNOME, you’ll create a Continuous
Release. If you are using the Wizard, you’ll simply choose this option.
If you are modifying the scenario using Setup View, start by
deleting existing spills from the previous examples.
Then click on the Create Spill Icon (plus sign) in the <strong>Spill</strong> panel.
Choose Continuous Release.</p>
<p>The spill duration in this example is 1
hour. Use the Add Endpoint button to specify a spill along a transit.</p>
<p>2. Use the Select/Change Oil button to to open the ADIOS oil library.
From this interface you can select an oil that corresponds to an IFO
or a diesel fuel. It doesn’t matter which exact oil you select, as long
as it falls into one of these broad categories.</p>

<h2>Answer:<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Heavier oils remain in the environment longer than
lighter, refined products. You should see that much more diesel has
evaporated and dispersed than fuel oil #6 after 24 hours in the
water.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-6">
<h2>Example 6<a class="headerlink" href="#example-6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The new Effluent Outfall Tunnel discharges wastewater in
Massachusetts Bay, about 14 km from Boston Harbor. Numerical modeling
studies suggest that the discharge will have little or no effect on
surface currents in the region in the summer and a small effect on
surface currents in the winter. To demonstrate how this discharge may
impact spilled oil trajectories, run a 100-barrel linear spill over the
outfall site from 42° 24.97’ N, 70° 47.04’ W to 42° 21.96’ N, 70° 46.98’
W. Leave the substance as the diesel used in the last example.
Start the spill at noon on February 15. Run WebGNOME twice for this
spill, once with the sewage outfall effects option turned on, and once
with no sewage outfall effects.</p>

<p>How does the wastewater outfall impact the oil’s trajectory?</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>
<p>To include the sewage outfall effects without relaunching the Wizard, you
will change a setting in the <strong>Current</strong> panel. Within this panel is a list of
surface current patterns that are described in the Location File User
Guide. Click the edit icon for the pattern labeled “Sewage Outfall Current”.
The Active checkbox is unchecked if you chose not to consider the outfall
effects when you set up the scenario. Click the checkbox to include this
current pattern.</p>

<h3>Answer:<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Few, if any, discernible changes result from adding the
effects of the sewage outfall; however, in the scenario that
includes the sewage outfall effects, there is an area in the middle
of the trajectory that tends to remain clear of oil.</p>
