<p>We want to know what you think about the services and products
you are receiving on the WebGNOME site, and whether you have suggestions
about how the site could be improved or made more useful.</p>

take our website satisfaction survey</a>.
It is 11 questions long and takes about 5 minute to complete.
</p>

<p>We will review the feedback and use it to improve our site;
however, we will not respond to any comments provided via the
survey. If you would like a response to a specific question, please
email us at
<a href="mailto:webgnome.help@noaa.gov">webgnome.help@noaa.gov</a>
(rather than putting it in the survey).</p>

confidentiality can be provided for responses, and you need not
supply your name or address. Any information you provide will be
used to for the sole purpose of improving NOAA's products and

<p>Responses to this survey will not be treated as official
correspondence to the agency, so you may not receive a reply from
NOAA. Do not use this survey to provide public comments on
rulemakings, respond to solicitations, or communicate about any
official agency action. Instead, provide your comments or feedback
as described in the action you want to respond to, or use a
designated channel for official comments (for example,
www.regulations.gov to comment on notices of rulemaking).</p>
