Select Spill Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   
Choose **Instantaneous Release** if the oil is spilled in an hour or less and you know the approximate total amount of oil spilled. This option can also be used if very little information is available about the release, but you are able to make an estimate of the amount spilled.

Choose **Continuous Release** if the oil is spilled over a period of time longer than one hour.
