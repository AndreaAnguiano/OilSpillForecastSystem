Disperse Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dispersant chemicals are a way to treat big spills that have spread over a large area. Dispersants reduce the surface tension between oil and water and therefore contribute to the dispersion of the surface oil as small droplets in the water column. Dispersion occurs naturally but is greatly enhanced by the addition of dispersing chemicals.
