Horizontal Diffusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Random spreading, i.e. diffusion, is included by a simple random walk with a square unit probability. 
The random walk is based on the **Diffusion Coefficient** which represents the horizontal 
eddy diffusivity in the water. The model default is 100,000 cm2 s-1.

The **Uncertain Factor** only applies if the Minimum Regret (Uncertainty) Solution option is 
selected in **Model Settings**. This factor will be randomly applied to the diffusion coefficient 
for the uncertainty particles.
