Variable Wind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A **Variable Wind** allows you to enter a series of wind information.

The **Inc. (hrs)** option specifies how often you\'d like to enter the wind time-series data. Six-hour increments are set by default.
Note that the **Date and Time** will automatically increment for the next entry based on the specified value, 
allowing you to ignore Date and Time once the initial values are set.  Date & Time can also be 
changed manually for each entry.

Choose the **Units** from the drop-down menu at the top of the table. The same units will be used for all wind speed entries.

To begin entering values, move your mouse over the top row which has been created with the current model start time and zero values for speed 
and direction. 

You wil see options to add a row using the specified hourly increment (+ icon), edit this row (pencil icon) or to 
delete a row (trashcan icon). Continue to add and edit rows until your time series is complete.

Editing values in a row
-----------------------
Enter values for **Speed** and **Direction** or use the wind bull\'s-eye.

**Direction** can be entered as degrees (between 0 and 360 degrees) or by the cardinal directions 
N, NE, NNE, NW, NNW, E, S, SE, SSE, SW, SSW, W. Cardinal directions will automatically be translated 
into degrees.

To select **Speed and Direction using the bull\'s-eye**, click and drag inside the bull\'s-eye to change 
the length of the arrow to represent speed and the direction of the arrow to indicate the direction of 
the wind.

Once Date & Time, Speed, and Wind Direction are entered, click the green checkmark to save the entry. 

Speed Uncertainty
-----------------
The **Speed Uncertainty (Oil Weathering)** option adds some variability to the magnitude of the winds that
affects oil weathering ONLY (uncertainty is handled differently in the oil transport and is activated 
from the Model Settings panel). |location_link|

Change the **Speed Uncertainty** slider by dragging the bar to the left for certain and to the right for 
uncertain to change the range of wind speed that will be used. Range is calculated using a Rayleigh 
distribution.
