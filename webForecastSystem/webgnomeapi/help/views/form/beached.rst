Observed Beached Oil
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This form allows the manual entry of volumes of observed beached oil for the mass balance. Note, if the trajectory is run with a map that contains land, 
the model may also cause oil to come ashore due to winds and currents. These processes are completely independent and values entered here will be removed 
from the mass balance as long as sufficient surface oil remains. (It is possible to enter larger values here than were actually released -- the amount will 
be reduced to the amount available at the time.) Manually input beached oil is considered to be permanently stranded and will not refloat.

* Select the units for the amount beached  (default is barrels)

* Enter the date and time for the observed beached oil or select the date and time using the calendar icon next to the entry box.

  * To enter a date and time manually, use date format yyyy/mm/dd and time format 00:00 (24-hour clock).

  * To select a date using the calendar, click on the calendar icon next to the start time entry. Click on the left or right arrows to change the month, and click on a date square to select it. Select a time from the list to the right of the calendar, scrolling up or down as necessary.

* Enter the amount beached for that time

* Click Add Entry.

* Repeat for each observation.

* Click Save.
