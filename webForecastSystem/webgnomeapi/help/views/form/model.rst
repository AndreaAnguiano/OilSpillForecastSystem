Model Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These settings are used to setup some basic parameters for your scenario.

* Choose a name for your incident (or use the default).
* Set the start time for your incident by clicking on the calendar or entering it in the box. Note, in general this should be the same as the spill start time.
* Set the Duration (this is how long the model will run).
* Choose whether to Include the Minimum Regret (Uncertainty) solution. |location_link|
