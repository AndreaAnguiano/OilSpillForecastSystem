Gridded Winds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Note: gridded winds are not currently supported for oil weathering algorithms. This is under development. Gridded winds can be
used to move particles, but only point winds are supported for oil weathering.**

Choose **Load Wind** to load wind data on a regular or curvilinear grid (e.g. output from a meteorological model). 
At present, only specific file formats are supported (eventually any CF-compliant file should be compatible). Details on the 
supported file formats can be found in the |location_link|. 

"WebGNOME-ready" files for some publically available models can also be downloaded from |location_link2|.
