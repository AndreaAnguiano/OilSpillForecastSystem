Choose **Load Surface Currents** to load ocean current data on a regular, curvilinear, or triangular grid (e.g. output from a hydrodynamic model). 
At present, only specific file formats are supported (eventually any CF-compliant file should be compatible). Details on the supported file formats
can be found in the |location_link|. 

"WebGNOME-ready" files for some publicly available models can also be downloaded from |location_link2|.

The **NOAA Emergency Response Model (CATS)** is a hydrodynamic model used by the NOAA Emergency Response Division.
