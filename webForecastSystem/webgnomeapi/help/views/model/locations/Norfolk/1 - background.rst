About Norfolk, Virginia
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Norfolk, Virginia Location File covers the James River from the western end of Jamestown Island to Chesapeake Bay. It also includes the Elizabeth River, from Paradise Creek to the James River. The James River originates in the Allegheny Mountains and flows to the southeast, terminating in the Chesapeake Bay. It drains approximately one fourth of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Commercial navigation extends from Chesapeake Bay up river approximately 80 miles [128 km] to Richmond, Virginia. 

Background
==================================

This Location File is designed to simulate the river flow from Jamestown Island to Chesapeake Bay. Hampton Roads is a natural tidal basin formed by the confluence of the James, Nansemond, and Elizabeth Rivers. The area has been a major anchorage point since colonial times. The port is located approximately 18 miles [29 km] from open ocean and is one of the world's deepest, natural ice-free harbors. 

At this point, the James and Elizabeth rivers are tidal, not inputting enough fresh water to significantly drive surface currents when compared to the tides.
