Current Patterns
=================================================

The Norfolk Location File contains one current pattern, which was developed using the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application. The tidal current pattern is scaled to the tidal prediction station at Carney Island Reach, station number 5276 (36° 53.43' N, 76° 20.15' W). The tidal pattern is reflective of a net outward transport of water from both the James and Elizabeth Rivers.
