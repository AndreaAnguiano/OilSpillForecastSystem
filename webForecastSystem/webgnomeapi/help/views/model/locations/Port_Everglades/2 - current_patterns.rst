Current Patterns
========================================

The Port Everglades Location File contains three current patterns: tides, Florida Power and Light discharge canal, and near shore for the outer coast.

All current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application. The tidal current pattern is scaled to the tidal prediction station near the 17th Street Bridge (26° 06.02' N, 80° 07.13' W). 

The Florida Power and Light discharge canal pattern can be turned on or off, with no option to modify the current speed.

The outside mean current pattern is set to flow from the north to the south. This pattern should not be relied upon to reflect any variability in the currents. Caution should be exercised with the use of these currents.
