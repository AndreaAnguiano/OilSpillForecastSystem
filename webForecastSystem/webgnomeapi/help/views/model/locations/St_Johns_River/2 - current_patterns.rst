Current Patterns
==========================================

Two current patterns are used in this Location File: one for tides and one for the nearshore circulation outside of the St. Johns River entrance. Both of these currents were created using the NOAA Circulation Analysis for Trajectory Simulations (CATS) hydrodynamic model. The tidal circulation is keyed to the main tide station at the St. Johns River entrance, which is located between the jetties. 

In this region, the alongshore flow can reverse, but most commonly flows to the north. We have scaled the offshore circulation to be approximately 10 centimeters/second (cm/s).
