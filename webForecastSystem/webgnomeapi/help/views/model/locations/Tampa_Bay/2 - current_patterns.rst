Current Patterns
===================================

The circulation of Tampa Bay and the surrounding areas is simulated with four tidal patterns and an offshore pattern. The tidal patterns were selected because they are each representative of different circulation regimes and have significant tidal phase differences (approximately one hour). The tide stations listed below were used to scale the current patterns in their areas:

- **Clearwater Pass** (0.2 mi NE of Sand Key)	27° 57.4' N,	82°, 49.4' W
- **Blind Pass**	27° 45.4' N,	82°, 45.7' W
- **Tampa Bay Entrance (Egmont Channel)**	27° 36.26' N, 82°, 45.62' W
- **Longboat Pass**	27° 26.5' N,	82°, 41.4' W

**Clearwater Pass** drives the circulation in the southern portion of St. Joseph Sound through Clearwater Harbor and The Narrows, including Hurricane Pass, Dunedin Pass, and Clearwater Pass. **Blind Pass** drives the circulation through south of The Narrows through Boca Ciega Bay, including Johns Pass and Blind Pass. **Tampa Bay Entrance** drives the circulation throughout Tampa Bay. **Longboat Pass** drives the circulation from Anna Maria Sound south through Sarasota Bay.

The **Offshore** current pattern is tied to the northerly component of the wind forecast and is scaled so that a south wind of 4.5 m/s will generate a 15 cm/s current to the north (after Cragg and Sturges 1974).
