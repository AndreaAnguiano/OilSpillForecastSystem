About Charleston Harbor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Charleston Harbor is an estuary along the southeast coast of the United States and serves as the major port for the city of Charleston, South Carolina. The estuary is formed by the junction of the Ashley, Cooper, and Wando Rivers at 32° 49.12’N, 79° 55.67’W. Charleston Harbor is part of the Intracoastal Waterway along the East Coast of the United States. 


Background
===========================

The currents within the modeled domain are mostly tidally driven, but there is a freshwater component to the flow. The Ashley and Wando Rivers are short and contribute limited runoff into the estuary. The Cooper River is the longest of the three rivers and contributes the significant amount of freshwater into the estuary. It extends upriver, to the north, and into Lake Moultrie. The flow from Lake Moultrie into the Cooper River is controlled by the Pinopolis Dam. The Charleston Harbor Location File is based on NOAA's tidal current predictions for various locations along the three rivers which incorporate average runoff conditions for each river.
