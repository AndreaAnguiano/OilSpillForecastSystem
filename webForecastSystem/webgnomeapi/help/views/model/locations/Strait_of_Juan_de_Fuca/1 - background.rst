About the Strait of Juan de Fuca
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Strait of Juan de Fuca is located in western Washington, along the border between Canada and the United States.


Background
======================================

The Strait of Juan de Fuca is a glacially carved fjord lying between Washington State and Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The western entrance to Juan de Fuca is about 200 m deep. Near Victoria, the shelf is about 60 m deep and extends southward to separate the Strait into eastern and western sections.
The eastern Strait separates about 135 km east of the mouth into a northern portion and a southern portion. The northern portion goes through the San Juan Archipelago (via Rosario Strait, Haro Strait and San Juan Channel) into the Strait of Georgia. The southern portion enters Puget Sound through Admiralty Inlet. The Strait of Juan de Fuca is a major transportation lane for Canadian and U.S. commercial and recreational ships and boats. There are oil refineries in Padilla Bay (off of Rosario Strait) and the Strait of Georgia.
