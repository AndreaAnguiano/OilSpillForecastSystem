Current Patterns
=======================================================

The circulation in the vicinity of San Juan is simulated with two current patterns: offshore and tidal currents. The offshore current pattern represents the large- scale westward wind drift currents and the net transport through the coral reef systems. The tidal current pattern represents the tidally driven currents in San Juan harbor.


**Offshore Currents**

In the nearshore area, the westward drift was assumed to result from a barotropic setdown. This change in sea level was simulated in the Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulations (CATS) Diagnostic Analysis for Currents (DAC) hydrodynamic model. Data were not available for the spatial variability of the nearshore surface currents around San Juan, so the current pattern was scaled from observations made during the Berman Barge grounding in 1994. Surface currents during the grounding were approximately 1/3 knot.


**Tidal Currents**

The CATS Streamfunction Analysis for Currents (SAC) hydrodynamic model was used to generate the tidally driven surface currents in San Juan harbor. The U.S. Coast Pilot indicates a mean tidal range of 1.1 feet; however, the wind is known to significantly alter the water level. Observations of the spatial and temporal variations of the surface currents in the harbor were unavailable.
Since tidal harmonics are not available for the area, the tidal height station of Punta del Morro was used. The tidal currents were simulated by scaling the time derivative of the sea level height by an estimate of the volume transport. The result was 0.1-knot (0.05 m/s) surface currents at the Punta del Morro station.
