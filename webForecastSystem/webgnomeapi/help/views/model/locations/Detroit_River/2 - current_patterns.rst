Current Patterns
====================================

The Detroit River Location File contains one current pattern. The current pattern was created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application. The tidal current pattern is calibrated using the NOAA Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) port stations in the Detroit River. It should be noted that the model should not be used if the river is ice covered.
