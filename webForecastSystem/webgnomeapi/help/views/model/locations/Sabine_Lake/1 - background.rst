About Port Arthur and Sabine Lake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Port Arthur and Sabine Lake are located in southeastern Texas. Sabine Lake is an inland estuary that straddles the Texas/Louisiana border near Beaumont, Texas. The lake is adjacent to a portion of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW), a coastal canal that extends about 1300 miles from Florida to Texas' southern tip. Port Arthur is an industrial city and deepwater port, located 90 miles east of Houston on Sabine Lake. With the cities of Beaumont (to the northwest) and Orange (to the northeast), it forms the "Golden Triangle," a large petrochemical and industrial complex.


Background
=================================

Port Arthur and Sabine Lake are located on a flat coastal plain in the western Gulf of Mexico. Elevations range from sea level to 9 feet on land. Deep areas in Sabine Pass and the canals are dredged to keep them open. Freshwater flows into Sabine Lake from the Sabine and Neches Rivers. Water flows out of Sabine Lake through Sabine Pass into the Gulf of Mexico.

The Sabine River flows for 555 miles. Its total drainage basin area is 9,756 square miles, of which 7,426 is in Texas and the remainder in Louisiana. Unlike most Texas rivers, the Sabine is entirely in an area of abundant rainfall. Average annual precipitation is between 37 inches at its source and 50 inches at its mouth. Overall, the river has a remarkably strong flow for its length, and it discharges the largest volume of water (over 6 million acre-feet) of all Texas rivers.

The Neches River flows southeast for 416 miles to its mouth on Sabine Lake, on the northeastern edge of Port Arthur. The river has a drainage area estimated at 10,011 square miles. Abundant rainfall in its basin results in a flow of about 4.6 million acre-feet per year.
