Current Patterns
========================================

This Location File has eight current patterns: one component of the wind-driven currents in the lagoon systems; and seven river systems: the Mackenzie, Colville, Kuparuk, Sagavanirktok (Sag), Shaviovik, Canning, and Tamayariak Rivers. All were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulations (CATS) hydrodynamic model.
