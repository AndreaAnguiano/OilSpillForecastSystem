Decision Tree
===================================================

In the decision tree, we will be referring to different current stations by their abbreviations. This list shows the general location of each current meter shown in the three circulation patterns:

* **SAMI**  Purisma Point
* **SMIN**  Point Conception
* **SMOF**  San Miguel Island
* **ANMI**  Eastern Entrance

The surface circulation patterns are simplified representations of a dynamic, changing system. They were developed statistically, although you can only expect to pick a single pattern unambiguously 60% of the time. Small-scale circulation features, transitions between synoptic states, and uncommon patterns can make it difficult to select a single circulation pattern. We have included information on the ranges within the patterns to help you narrow down your choices. If your data does not fit any of the above circulation patterns, you may be in a transitional period, or smaller-scale phenomena (e.g., eddies) may be masking the larger-scale circulation that might otherwise be evident in the current meter reading. You may want to look at the data for the previous few days to improve your sense of what is happening in the channel.

Remember, currents are described by where they are flowing to, and winds are described by where they are blowing from. So winds and currents in the same direction (e.g., both to the south) are described from different directions [e.g. south(ward) current and north wind].

**What season of the year?**

- If spring, then look at UPWELLING.
- If summer, then look at CONVERGENT.
- If autumn or winter, then look at RELAXATION.

**Compare SAMI and ANMI currents**

- If both currents are flowing equator ward, then look at UPWELLING.
- If both currents are flowing poleward (although ANMI could be flowing across the entrance), then look at RELAXATION.
- If the currents are pointing toward each other, then look at CONVERGENT.

**Compare the two stations at the western entrance to the Santa Barbara Channel: SMIN and SMOF**

- If both are about the same magnitude (arrows the same size) but pointing in different directions (SMIN westward and SMOF eastward), then look at CONVERGENT.
- If SMIN shows currents flowing westward at 50 cm/s or more and SMOF is flowing between as fast westward to more slowly eastward, then look at RELAXATION.
- If SMIN shows currents flowing southward or weakly westward (<10 cm/s) and SMOF is flowing faster and toward the east, then look at UPWELLING.

**Look at winds at NDBC buoy 46054**

- If weak or SE winds (<4 m/s), then look at RELAXATION.
- If strong (>8 m/s) NW winds, then look at UPWELLING.
- If strong (>7 m/s) NW winds, then look at CONVERGENT.

**Look at the winds in the area**

- If winds have been strong (>10 m/s) and equator ward for several days, then look at UPWELLING or, possibly, CONVERGENT; otherwise, consider RELAXATION or CONVERGENT.
- If winds in the SMB are onshore or equatorward and winds in the SBC are relatively weak, then look at UPWELLING or, possibly CONVERGENT; otherwise, consider RELAXATION or CONVERGENT.
