Current Patterns
==================================

The tidal current pattern was simulated in the NOAA Circulation Analysis for Trajectory Simulations (CATS) hydrodynamic model using the WAC submodel with shallow water wave dynamics. The tidal time dependence is simulated using the tidal coefficients from the tidal station west of Beardslee Island (58° 28' N, 136° 02' W).
