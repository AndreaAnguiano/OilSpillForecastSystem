Current Patterns
===================================

The currents in the San Diego Bay area are simulated with four current patterns. The two most significant circulations are the tides and the offshore current. Although the tides in San Diego Bay are asymmetrical (Chadwick and Largier 1999), they have been simulated as symmetrical in the Location File because, at this time, GNOME does not support separate tidal current patterns for flood and ebb. The Location File tides within the bay are controlled by the San Diego Bay Entrance Tide Station. Offshore currents are scaled to always flow southward in the Location File. These current patterns also simulate the diminished currents in the kelp forests off Point Loma.

To simulate wind-driven currents in the Location File, two current patterns were developed, one with NNW winds and the other with orthogonal (WSW) winds. These current patterns are scaled with the relative component of the user's wind data. The approximately 3% ratio of currents to winds from Gaul and Stewart (1960) is used to scale the wind-driven currents to the wind.

All current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application.
