Current Patterns
========================================

The Casco Bay Location File uses one current pattern to simulate tidal circulation. The tidal current pattern is scaled to tides in the Portland Harbor entrance southwest of Cushing Island (43.63°N, 70.21°W).

The current pattern was created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application.
