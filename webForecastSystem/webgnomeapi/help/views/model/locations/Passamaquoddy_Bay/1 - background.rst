About Passamaquoddy Bay, Maine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Passamaquoddy Bay straddles the United States-Canada border between the province of New Brunswick in eastern Canada and the northeastern state of Maine. Passamaquoddy Bay is an inlet of the Bay of Fundy at the mouth of the St. Croix River. Most of the bay lies within New Brunswick; however, this Location File covers the U.S. portion of the bay.

Passamaquoddy Bay is home to the largest tidal whirlpool in the western hemisphere. The Old Sow whirlpool is located off the southwestern shore of Deer Island, New Brunswick between the island and Eastport, Maine. The whirlpool is caused by variations in local bathymetry combined with the extreme tidal range of the Western Passage where waters exchange between Passamaquoddy Bay and the Bay of Fundy. It has been measured with a diameter of approximately 75 meters (250 feet). Old Sow generally creates tremendous water turbulence locally, but it does not usually constitute a navigation hazard for larger vessels; small craft are warned to avoid these waters when the tide is running. This feature is too small to simulate in this larger scale Location File.


Background
==============================

The tidal range (>20 feet with extremes nearing 30 feet) in Passamaquoddy Bay can present a challenge to navigation and piloting. The tidal range increases as you sail from west to east along the coast of Maine and New Brunswick, Canada. Starting with a range of 9 feet or so in Kittery, it reaches about 19 feet in Eastport, and 25 feet in Saint John, New Brunswick. The Bay of Fundy is known for having the world's largest tidal range at over 45 feet (The Hopewell Rocks).
