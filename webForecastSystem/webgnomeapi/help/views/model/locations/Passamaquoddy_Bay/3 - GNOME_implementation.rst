GNOME Implementation
==============================================

Typically, tidal current simulations in GNOME Location Files use a single current pattern driven by tidal harmonics. In order to capture the large tidal variation in Passamaquoddy Bay and allow for wetting and drying of the shoreline, twelve representative tide patterns covering a tidal cycle were selected and driven by the tide station at Estes Head. These patterns consist of maximum flood, minimum before ebb, maximum ebb, and minimum before flood, with two patterns in between each. The Lunar Semidiurnal or M2 tidal constituents were used to get a picture of the phase changes of the typical circulation over a tidal cycle (roughly 12 hours) with the tide station used to calibrate the amplitude. When the model is run, GNOME determines where in the tide cycle the flow is at a given time, then selects the appropriate two patterns to use and interpolates as necessary. Each pattern identifies any dry grid points so GNOME is able to simulate the shoreline edge movement from the rising and falling tide.
