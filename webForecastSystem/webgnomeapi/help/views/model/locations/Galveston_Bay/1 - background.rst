About Galveston Bay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Galveston Bay is an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico, on the southeastern shore of Texas, U.S.A. Galveston Bay's 600 square miles of surface area is commonly divided into four major sub-bays: Galveston Bay, Trinity Bay, West Bay and East Bay. Galveston Bay receives freshwater from three main tributaries (the Trinity and San Jacinto rivers and Buffalo Bayou), and receives saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico.


Background
==================================

Galveston Bay is broad and very shallow (typically only 6-12 feet deep), except for dredged channels. Winds and tides dominate the circulation in the bay. However, meteorological tides (storm surge) can significantly raise or lower sea level, causing extensive flooding and currents that can overcome the tides. Even modest storms can affect sea level more than the astronomical tides when there is a persistent onshore or offshore wind.
