Trajectory
^^^^^^^^^^

This view shows the trajectory of the oil along with various basemaps and environmental data (e.g. currents and winds) 
(see Layers).

**Running the trajectory**

The spill duration indicator along the top includes a rewind, play/pause and fast forward button.
You may also go to any spot in the model run by dragging the bar, by clicking at any spot in 
the spill duration bar, or by hovering the mouse over the spill duration indicator and using the 
arrow keys to advance the run one timestep at a time. The date and time of the spill changes 
as the trajectory model runs.

Begin by pressing the triangular play button at the top of the screen. Look at the map and find 
the black dots that represent the moving oil. You can move the map by clicking and dragging (panning) and 
zoom in and out using your mouse scroll wheel (or by right-clicking and dragging with your mouse).

**Recording a movie**

To save a gif animation of your simulation, use the Record button on the top left. The pull down menu allows specification of frame rates and 
output formats (only GIF is currently supported). You can choose to record the entire simulation or some portion of it. Start by clicking the 
record button, then use the play/pause buttons to run the simulation (if the model is rewould the play will start automatically. 
To finish, hit the record button a second time. It may take a little while to generate the file, you will see an hour glass icon while the file is being processed.

**Export model data**

Use the pull down Export menu on the top menu bar to save your model data in NetCDF, KMZ, or Shapefile formats.

**Tools (Under development)**

*Ruler Tool* - Use the ruler to measure distances on the map. Click on the ruler icon on the left side of the screen. Click once where you wish to begin measuring and double-click at the point where you wish to stop. Distances are displayed in nautical miles, miles, and kilometers. Note: If the line seems to disappear after double-clicking, measure again and double-click slower. Clicking on a line will delete it.

*Area Tool* - Use the area tool to measure the area of a polygon.  Click on the area icon on the left side of the screen. Click once where you wish to begin measuring and at each point of the polygon. If you double-click on any point on the map before you close the polygon, the program will automatically close the polygon for you. Distances are displayed in nautical miles squared, square miles, and square kilometers. Clicking on a polygon will delete it.
